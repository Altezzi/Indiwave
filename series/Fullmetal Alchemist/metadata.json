  "description": "*In order to obtain or create something, something of equal value must be lost or destroyed.* That is the core tenet of alchemy.   \n  \nAfter the death of their mother, brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric decided to do the impossible: use alchemy to bring her back to life. However, their ritual went horribly wrong: Edward lost his leg, while Alphonse lost his whole body. Wanting nothing but to bring his brother back, Edward sacrificed his arm to bond his soul with a suit of armor.   \n  \nEquipped with mechanical \"auto-mail\" limbs, Edward becomes a state alchemist, seeking the one thing that can restore his brother and himselfâ€¦ the legendary Philosopher's Stone.  \n  \nThe classic manga returns, now fully colored and reformatted into a long-strip Korean webtoon to read on a smartphone.",
