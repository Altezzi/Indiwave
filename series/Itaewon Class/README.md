# Itaewon Class

In a neighborhood known for its diversity, delicious food, and spunk, ex-convict Park Saeroyi works to put his hole-in-the-wall pub on the map. This is just one step in his 15-year plan to live a life that would have made his father proud. As his pub attracts its own unique crew, Saeroyi embarks on the next phase: taking down the very family who stole his father away from him. It’s time for revenge and to prove to the world what he’s worth.
