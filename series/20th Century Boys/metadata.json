  "description": "As the 20th century approaches its end, people all over the world are anxious that the world is changing. And probably not for the better.\n\nKenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop.\n\nKenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.\n\n--- \n**Awards Won:**\n\n- Winner of the 25th [Kodansha Manga Award]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodansha_Manga_Award) for General Manga in 2001.\n- Winner of the 48th [Shogakukan Manga Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogakukan_Manga_Award) for General Manga in 2002.\n- Winner of the 2008 [Seiun Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiun_Award) for Best Comic at the 46th Japan Science Fiction Convention.\n- Winner of the 2011 [Eisner Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_Awards#Past_winners) for Best U.S. Edition of International Material-Asia.\n\n---\n  \nSee [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/manga/3/20th_Century_Boys) for Manga Details.\n\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Boys)",
