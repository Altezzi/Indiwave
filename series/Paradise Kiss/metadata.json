  "description": "Yukari wants nothing more than to make her parents happy by studying hard and getting into a good college. One afternoon, however, she is kidnapped by a group of self-styled fashion-obsessed artists who call themselves \"Paradise Kiss.\" Yukari suddenly finds herself flung into the roller-coaster life of the fashion world, guided by George, art-snob extraordinaire. In a glamorous makeover of body, mind and soul, she is turned from a hapless bookworm into her friends own exclusive clothing model.  \n\nIn this manga we meet characters from Gokinjo Monogatari like Mikako (and her little sister, Miwako - she's in \"ParaKiss\" group) and Arashi's father (only poster, but still) and new like Isabella.",
