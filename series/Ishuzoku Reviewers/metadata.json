  "description": "In our world, the human race constantly debates about several important issues, such as: which girl is the best girl? How good is something as fapping material? Which fetish is the sexiest? And why your Waifu is the best while everyone else has shit taste... Accompany these great warriors as they present us with different girls, different opinions, different boners, showing us that their fantasy world may not be all that different from ours, as they analyze and meticulously review the most important thing of all: what they should put their **** in.",
