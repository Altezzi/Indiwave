  "description": "In a world where hunters with various magical powers battle monsters from invading the defenceless humanity, Sung Jin-Woo is one of the weakest hunters of all mankind. E-rank hunter Jin-Woo, having no skills whatsoever to speak of, barely makes a living by fighting in low-leveled dungeons... at least until he finds himself in a fight for his life in a high-leveled dungeon. However, this becomes a blessing in disguise when Jin-Woo awakens as a player in the system of the game.",
