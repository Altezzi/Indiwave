  "description": "Growing up in the late 16th century Sengoku era Japan, Shinmen Takezou is shunned by the local villagers as a devil child due to his wild and violent nature. Running away from home with a fellow boy at age 17, Takezo joins the Toyotomi army to fight the Tokugawa clan at the Battle of Sekigahara. However, the Tokugawa win a crushing victory, leading to nearly three hundred years of Shogunate rule.

However, after their paths separate, Takezo becomes a wanted criminal and must change his name and his nature in order to escape an ignoble death.  \n  \n**Awards:**\n- Won the 24th Kodansha Manga Award in the general category in 2000.\n- Won the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002 \n**Note:** was nominated for the 2003 Eisner Award in the Best Writer/Artist category.",
