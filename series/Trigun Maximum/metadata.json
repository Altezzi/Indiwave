  "description": "Vash the Stampede rises again! It's been two years since the mysterious and super-nice gunman went into hiding, and the people of his desert planet are suffering. It takes a friend in peril to bring him out, and when he does, his enemies come chasing… as well as those crazy insurance girls, Millie and Meryl. And Wolfwood the wandering priest? Well, that's who found him in the first place! The gang's all back, and the trouble is coming in Trigun Maximum.\n\nNotes:\n - Nightow changed publishers to Shonen Gahosha and the series continued to be serialized in Young King Ours magazine. Due to the original publisher retaining the name Trigun, Nightow had to change the title to Trigun Maximum, which isn´t a sequel but a new name for the rest of the series. \n- The first 3 volumes were published under the title 'Trigun' and the entire series compiled into 14 books as 'Trigun Maximum' (the numbering was also restarted when the title changed).\n - Won the Seiun Award at the 48th Japan Science Fiction Conventionwere for the best comic of the year.",
