There, she stumbled upon a massive tiger with an injured paw. 'Eat me,' the tiger requested as a reward for her help. Baekhui, the tiger king, was dumbfounded by this unusual request but couldn't help but salivate at the sight of Eunwoo. 'Such a delicious-looking face,' he thought. From that day forward, Baekhui was consumed by thoughts of how to savor her. In his quest to make her his mate, he relentlessly pursues her with seductive charms... A thrilling tale of seduction and conquest, featuring Baekhui, the ever-flirtatious tiger, and Eunwoo, the pure yet resolute Joseon princess!",
