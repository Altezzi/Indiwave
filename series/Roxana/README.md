# Roxana

Kidnapping, murder, and risqué relationships! Within the scandalous pages of *The Abysmal Flower*, the downfall of Roxana Agrece's criminal family is already foretold. So when Cassis Pedelian, the heroine’s older brother, is kidnapped by Roxana's father, she can either wait for the heroine's revenge... or take matters into her own hands, since Cassis is the key to her survival. But with deceitful characters on all sides, can Roxana and Cassis trust each other enough to bring down the brutal Agreces?

I accidentally took possession of someone in a 19+ reverse harem novel.

The problem is that I became Roxanna Agriche, the older sister of the sub-villain. My damn father kidnapped the heroine's brother. Now, is the only thing left to meet a terrible end from the vengeance of the heroine?

But what if I can avoid that horrible development?

“I'm also interested in this toy.”

"I'll protect you until you can get out of here safely."

The heroine's brother, Cassis Pedalian, will definitely be able to pay me back later.
