# Hellbound

Repent, or face hell on Earth! In Seoul, apparitions have started appearing before those who have done wrong to notify them of when they will die. A new religious group explains these happenings as God condemning people to make them live more righteously. Detective Jin is assigned to investigate the latest incident, just as his wifeâ€™s murderer is scheduled to be released from prison.
