  "description": "This is the story of Kaiman, a guy who does not remember who he was before he was transfigured by a Magic user. \nThis transformation left him with a reptile's head, and a desire to find out the truth about who he really is. \nAccompanied by Nikaido, his female companion, he tracks down Magic Users in \"The Hole\" and unceremoniously \nchomps down on their head, hoping to find out who it was that put him in this state. \nOne by one, they witness this \"second man\" inside the head of Kaiman, and after pulling them back out of his mouth \nhe asks them all a question \"What did the guy inside my head say?\"  \n\n\n---",
