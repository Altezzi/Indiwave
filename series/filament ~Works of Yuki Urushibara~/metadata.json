  "description": "Includes:  \nShe Got Off the Bus at the Peninsula (chapter 1):  \nMitsuko Kunizaki has inherited a small grocery store from her grandmother. Being a single mother to a little boy, she intends to close it down and move on with life. However, in the solitary store that sits next to the last bus stop at the tip of a peninsula lie some long-buried memories that slowly reemerge as Mitsuko arrives at what used to be her home—memories of a lonesome childhood and of people who came to the peninsula to end their lives.  \n  \nThe Labyrinth Cat (chapter 2):  \nResidents who have just moved in are always lost in this complex apartment. However, there is one little feline that will help them get back to their apartment house.",
