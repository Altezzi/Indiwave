# The Villainess' Maker

Yoon Haneul has always been a pushover, someone who would never say no. Then one day, she opens her eyes and realizes that she has become Aila Mertensia, the antagonist of a novel she had written ten years ago. Haneul is content to live the life of a rich couch potato and binge-read novels. But to her dismay, she soon finds herself stuck in a time loop where her day repeats endlessly, and the only way to escape the loop is to act like Aila Mertensia! Haneul doesn’t know the first thing about acting like a villainess. Luckily for her, a mysterious warlock by the name of Killian offers to help her become a true villainess. Her only option is to make a deal with him, but can Haneul really trust this devilishly handsome man?

I have transmigrated into a romance fantasy novel I wrote 10 years ago. On top of that, I reincarnated into the villainess, Ayla, who attempted to curse the female lead and got herself killed by the male lead for it. Then, it should be fine as long as I don't become a villainess, right?

"I'll live this life playing around like a jobless millionaire!"

However, before long, the days began repeating itself because I wasn't acting like the original villainess, Ayla.

"Please stop this loop…."
"The solution is simple. Become a true villainess."
"A true villainess?"
"Wealth, power, glory, men- you can have everything. If you wanted, I would gladly steal the crown for you and place it on your head."

The seemingly dangerous, mysterious and demon-like man, whispered those sweet, tempting words in my ears with a gentle voice.

"So, what's your answer?"

Can Ayla really become a true villainess in order to stop the time loop? The start of enticing lessons by a devil to become a true 'villainess', "Villainess Maker."
