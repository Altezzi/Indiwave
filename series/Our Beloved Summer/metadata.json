  "description": "At Midsummer High, Yeon-Su Guk is at the top of her class, while Wung Choi is ranked dead-last. And it’s not just their grades -- their personalities couldn’t be more different, as Yeon-Su is a no-nonsense stickler and Wung is a care-free slacker. When a filmmaker comes to make a documentary about their school life over the course of a month, they’re not exactly thrilled to be spending so much time together. However, as the month goes on, they begin to discover each other’s hidden depths. At least one thing’s for certain - they’ll never forget this summer!\n\nNote:\n\nThis webtoon is a prequel to the Kdrama, Our Beloved Summer, the webtoon will focus on Choi Wung and Guk Yeonsu in their high school days.",
