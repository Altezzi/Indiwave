# Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai: Man●hen

In a dystopian future, Japanese authorities are cracking down on anyone caught using any risqué language or distributing lewd materials in the country, to the point where all citizens are forced to wear high-tech chokers analysing their every spoken word. A new high-school student named Tanukichi Okuma enters the country's leading elite "public morals school" to reunite with his crush and student council President, Anna Nishikinomiya. However, Tanukichi quickly finds himself entwined with the perverted terrorist "Blue Snow" when she kidnaps and forces him to join her organization, "SOX," in spreading semi-pornographic material across the city.
