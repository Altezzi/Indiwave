  "description": "Minami \"Ikki\" Itsuki, is a student and a delinquent. Also known as the \"Unbeatable Babyface\", Ikki is the leader of the youth gang going by the name of \"East Side Gunz\". Upon his return home after being humiliated by a street gang of Storm Riders called the Skull Saders, Ikki discovers a secret hidden from him by his benefactors, the Noyamano sisters. The sisters belong to a group of Storm Riders who go by the team name of Sleeping Forest. Keen on helping Ikki to regain his confidence and pride, they supply him with a pair of Air Trecks (abbreviated as \"AT\"). Ikki eventually settles his grudge with the Skull Saders, but in the process he receives more than the simple satisfaction of revenge. Determined to experience the sensation of flight for as long as he can, our headstrong protagonist is quickly sucked into the mysterious, yet irresistible world of Air Treck.  \n  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6251) for the anime.  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11722) for OAV (side story).",
