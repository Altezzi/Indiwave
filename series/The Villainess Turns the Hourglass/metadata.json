  "description": "With the marriage of her prostitute mother to the Count, Aria’s status in society skyrocketed immediately. After leading a life of luxury, Aria unfairly meets death because of her sister Mielle’s schemes. And right before she dies, she sees an hourglass fall as if it were a fantasy. And just like that, she was miraculously brought back to the past.\n\n“I want to become a very elegant person, just like my sister, Mielle.”\n\nIn order to face the villainess, she must become an even more wicked villainess. This was the new path Aria chose to take revenge on Mielle who murdered both her and her mother.\n\n---\nAfter her lowly mother married a count, Aria enjoyed a life full of luxury while harassing her gentle stepsister Mielle. Several years later, Aria is about to be executed when Mielle reveals that she wickedly tricked Aria into building the bad reputation that ultimately brought her to the scaffold. Just as Aria desperately wishes she could change her fate, she sees a curious hourglass that takes her back into the past. \n\nNow, Aria can destroy Mielle by using her own tactics against her like a true villainess. The power of the hourglass is on her side... \n\nCan Aria take everything from Mielle, or will her actions change the past in ways she couldn't have imagined? Based on the hit novel.",
