  "description": "They arrive in silence and darkness. They descend from the skies. They have a hunger for human flesh. They are everywhere. They are parasites, alien creatures who must invade - and take control of - a human host to survive. And once they have infected their victims, they can assume any deadly form they choose: monsters with giant teeth, winged demons, creatures with blades for hands. But most have chosen to conceal their lethal purpose behind ordinary human faces. So no one knows their secret - except an ordinary high school student. Shin is battling for control of his own body against an alien parasite, but can he find a way to warn humanity of the horrors to come?\n\n[Alternate Official English](https://kodansha.us/series/parasyte/)\n\n---\n- **Won the Kodansha Manga Award for General Manga in 1993**\n- **Won the Seiun Award for Best Comic in 1996**",
