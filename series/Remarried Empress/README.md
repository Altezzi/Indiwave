# Remarried Empress

Navier was the perfect Empress and a masterful administrator and regent for the empire; however, she and the Emperor were not lovers, and the Emperor wanted a wife, not a colleague. And so, he sought a concubine and placed a secretly ambitious slave girl beside him. That was fine, as she was willing to allow him his concubine of choiceâ€¦ until Navier heard the Emperor promised the slave girl the Empress' position. After much agonizing, Navier decided to marry the king of the neighboring kingdom.
