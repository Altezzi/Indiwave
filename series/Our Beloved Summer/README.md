# Our Beloved Summer

At Midsummer High, Yeon-Su Guk is at the top of her class, while Wung Choi is ranked dead-last. And it’s not just their grades -- their personalities couldn’t be more different, as Yeon-Su is a no-nonsense stickler and Wung is a care-free slacker. When a filmmaker comes to make a documentary about their school life over the course of a month, they’re not exactly thrilled to be spending so much time together. However, as the month goes on, they begin to discover each other’s hidden depths. At least one thing’s for certain - they’ll never forget this summer!
