  "description": "Yoon Haneul has always been a pushover, someone who would never say no. Then one day, she opens her eyes and realizes that she has become Aila Mertensia, the antagonist of a novel she had written ten years ago. Haneul is content to live the life of a rich couch potato and binge-read novels. But to her dismay, she soon finds herself stuck in a time loop where her day repeats endlessly, and the only way to escape the loop is to act like Aila Mertensia! Haneul doesn’t know the first thing about acting like a villainess. Luckily for her, a mysterious warlock by the name of Killian offers to help her become a true villainess. Her only option is to make a deal with him, but can Haneul really trust this devilishly handsome man?\n\n---\nI have transmigrated into a romance fantasy novel I wrote 10 years ago. On top of that, I reincarnated into the villainess, Ayla, who attempted to curse the female lead and got herself killed by the male lead for it. Then, it should be fine as long as I don't become a villainess, right?\n\n\"I'll live this life playing around like a jobless millionaire!\"\n\nHowever, before long, the days began repeating itself because I wasn't acting like the original villainess, Ayla.\n\n\"Please stop this loop….\"\n\"The solution is simple. Become a true villainess.\"\n\"A true villainess?\"\n\"Wealth, power, glory, men- you can have everything. If you wanted, I would gladly steal the crown for you and place it on your head.\"\n\nThe seemingly dangerous, mysterious and demon-like man, whispered those sweet, tempting words in my ears with a gentle voice.\n\n\"So, what's your answer?\"\n\nCan Ayla really become a true villainess in order to stop the time loop? The start of enticing lessons by a devil to become a true 'villainess', \"Villainess Maker.\"\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EB%85%80-%EB%A9%94%EC%9D%B4%EC%BB%A4/2456), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=56291021)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-villainesss-maker)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc29741)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%83%A1%E5%A5%B3%E6%8E%A8%E6%89%8B/215)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/the-villainesss-maker-fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/comics/the-villainesss-maker-de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Pencipta-Penjahat-Wanita/27)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/69189)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C/189)",
