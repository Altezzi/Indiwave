# Clock Tower GHOST HEAD

A prologue comic to HUMAN Entertainment's horror game "Clock Tower GHOST HEAD" (localized as "Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within").  
  
A follow-up comic was released in Japan.  
  
Due to localization differences, two versions of the comic have been put up: the Ghost Head version is the original, the Struggle Within version has the US localized game differences included to make it easier for international fans to read.  
  
The comic itself was bundled in with the Clock Tower GHOST HEAD The Method to Capture Victory Guidebook and was not released outside of Japan.
