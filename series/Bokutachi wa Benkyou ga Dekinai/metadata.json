  "description": "Yuiga Nariyuki wasn't always a top-notch student; he had to study intensively to get where he is. Even so, he is constantly outperformed by literary genius Furuhashi and science whiz Ogata. When he's supposed to be preparing for college entrance exams, Yuiga is ordered by the headmaster to tutor both these girlsâ€”in the subjects with which they struggle the most! How will he manage to get results out of these geniuses?",
