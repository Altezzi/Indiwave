  "description": "What kind of dogs are there?\n\n\"The person who will be my groom is already dead!\"\n\nIt's unfair that she died so absurdly, but she possessed the villain. And that, of course, while holding a 'soul wedding'! All he has is a sunfish body and a run-down mansion.\n\nNo, the dead groom isn't rich, but he even has debts? It's the original, it's Nabal, and I have to find my way of life first!\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Fitzren came to visit her, claiming to be a close friend of her late husband. If this man touches the hearts of modern people by making warm bath water and iced americano, I think he can be a good shield to overcome this harsh world...\n\n\"Please be my fake mistress!\"",
