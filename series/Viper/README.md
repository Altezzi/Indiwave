Successfully catching the eye of Gangho's ruthless boss, Kwon Jaeha, Yujun tries to secure his position by pleading for his life and offering to do anything Jaeha asks. But when Jaeha responds with a chilling demand, "Strip down," Yujun realizes that survival in this dangerous game demands more than just loyalty—it requires total submission.
