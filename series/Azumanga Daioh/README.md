# Azumanga Daioh

It's not manga, it's Azumanga! âˆ’ smart, fun, and totally addictive. Created by the iconoclastic Kiyohiko Azuma, Azumanga Daioh is strongly character driven, taking the reader through the daily tribulations of Miss Kurosawa, Miss Yukari, the wild Tomo, hair-triggered Yomi, ditzy Osaka, brash Kagura, cute Chiyo-chan, and athletic (but girly) Sakaki.
