Each new species he discovers earns him a hefty reward, but this dandy has to be quick on his feet because it's first come, first served! Accompanied by his sidekicks, a rundown robot named QT and Meow the cat-looking space alien, Dandy bravely explores unknown worlds inhabited by a variety of aliens. Join the best dressed alien hunter in all of space and time as he embarks on an adventure that ends at the edge of the universe!  
  
Space Dandy! He's a dandy guy… in space. He combs the galaxy like his pompadour looking for aliens. Planet after planet he searches, finding species both dangerous, and not. These are the adventures of Space Dandy and his brave space crew… in space.
