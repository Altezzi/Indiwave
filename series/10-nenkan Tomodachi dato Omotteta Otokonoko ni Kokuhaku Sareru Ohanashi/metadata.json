  "description": "Rintarou, the boy I've been friends with since we were small. Large, grim, popular. He turned down a girl again… What a waste!\n\n“No, because I love you.”\n\n…Huh? What!? That's the first time I've heard about this!!! W-w-w-why me-\n\nDamn…!!! I can't believe he would confess to me. I feel like I lost and it's frustrating. Now that it's come to this, I'll test him and see if he's good enough to be my boyfriend!!",
