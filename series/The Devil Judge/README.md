# The Devil Judge

Kang Yohan rises to fame as the first judge to preside a nationally broadcasted trial.

With his decisive judgement and good looks, he is lauded a hero to bring much-needed change in the Korean justice system.

However, his junior judge Kim, Ga-on, finds something amiss about Yohan... whose sociopathic tendencies suggest he may be not entirely what he seems...

Is Kang Yohan a truly heoric judge as the people think? Or is he just a devil in disguise?
