"I break off my engagement to you!"

The crown prince threw this line at Sylvie at the school's graduation ceremony, and the villainous daughter Sylvie smiled with satisfaction. With a smile on her face, she says, "Yes! I will gladly accept! I will gladly accept!" She was accused of bullying the Dauphin's girlfriend, but she debunked the allegation with a brilliant alibi: "I was digging radishes in the dungeon." With the fee she had collected and her S-class adventurer's license in hand, Sylvie moved comfortably to a farm.

She is ready to start living the slow life she has dreamed of for so long! But then, the second prince, the brother of her former fianc√©, arrives on the scene! It seems that he sees Sylvie as a dangerous person who is avenging the royal family, and he often stays in the house to watch over her...
