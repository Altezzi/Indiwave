# 10-nenkan Tomodachi dato Omotteta Otokonoko ni Kokuhaku Sareru Ohanashi

Rintarou, the boy I've been friends with since we were small. Large, grim, popular. He turned down a girl again… What a waste!

“No, because I love you.”

…Huh? What!? That's the first time I've heard about this!!! W-w-w-why me-

Damn…!!! I can't believe he would confess to me. I feel like I lost and it's frustrating. Now that it's come to this, I'll test him and see if he's good enough to be my boyfriend!!
