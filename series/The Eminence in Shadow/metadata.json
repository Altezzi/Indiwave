  "description": "Just like how everyone adored heroes in their childhood, a certain young man adored those powers hidden in shadows. Ninjas, rogues, shadowy mentor types, that sort of deal.  \r\nAfter hiding his strength and living the mediocre life of a NPC by day while undergoing frenzied training by night, he finally reincarnates into a different world and gains ultimate power.  \r\nThe young man who is only pretending to be a power in the shadows… his subordinates who took him more seriously than he expected… and a giant organization in the shadows that gets accidentally trampled…  \r\nThis is the story of a young boy who had adored powers in shadows possibly eventually reigning over the world of shadows in another world.",
