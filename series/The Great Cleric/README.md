# The Great Cleric

Once upon a time, the God of Fate of Earth and the Chief God of Galdarudia made a wager. The God of Fate lost the bet and was forced to choose 10 common souls to hand over to the Chief God of Galdarudia. The Chief God of Galdarudia gave each of the 10 souls a new ability. Amongst those ordinary souls exists one salaryman who thwarted his fated demise. How will this man grow from this point forward? The God of Fate, the Chief God of Galdarudia, and even the author have no idea!

One man's story of turning blood, sweat, and tears into a successful livingâ€”literally! After his untimely death as the hardest-working salary man in Japan, Luciel is reincarnated into the magical fantasy world Galdardia. Always the man with a plan, he recreates himself to be a healer, and sets about making his way in the world. But while Luciel knows a thing or two about making money, he knows absolutely nothing about Galdardia. Will his good heart and great work ethic be enough to make him... The Great Cleric?
