  "description": "Guts, known as the Black Swordsman, seeks sanctuary from the demonic forces attracted to him and his woman because of a demonic mark on their necks, and also vengeance against the man who branded him as an unholy sacrifice. Aided only by his titanic strength gained from a harsh childhood lived with mercenaries, a gigantic sword, and an iron prosthetic left hand, Guts must struggle against his bleak destiny, all the while fighting with a rage that might strip him of his humanity.\n___\nWon the 6th Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize Excellence Award in 2002.\n\nNote: Following Miura Kenta's death in 2021, the series has been taken over by Kouji Mori, who supervises the series with art done by Studio Gaga.",
