# The Handmaiden Dreams At Sunset

On Dahlia Belohr's first day as handmaiden, she simply receives one instruction: Whatever you do, do not, under any circumstances, go to the annex. 

But when an errand meant for another maid falls on her lap, Dahlia reluctantly finds herself walking through the very doors she was forbidden from entering and meetshim. The ghost of the annex. A permanent stain on the duke's legacy. The cursed bas**** boy. 

What blooms is an unexpected connection that heals the pit of loneliness in both their hearts, despite the constant outside threats wanting to keep them apart.
