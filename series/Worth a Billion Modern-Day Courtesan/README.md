# Worth a Billion: Modern-Day Courtesan

Yoshiwara, old Edo's paradise of pleasure, has been reborn in modern-day Tokyo…. In this playground of the powerful, where money rules all, women sell both their bodies and the idea of romance to their male clientele. Thrust into this world is the ingenue Asuka, who's been sold out by her foster parents to pay off their debts. While at first oblivious to the nature of Yoshiwara, she accidentally barges in on a “transaction” between a courtesan and her client. Confronted with her new reality of being bought and sold, she longs to make a break for it… but is there anyone around her she can trust…?! (MangaPlaza)
