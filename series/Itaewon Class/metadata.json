  "description": "In a neighborhood known for its diversity, delicious food, and spunk, ex-convict Park Saeroyi works to put his hole-in-the-wall pub on the map. This is just one step in his 15-year plan to live a life that would have made his father proud. As his pub attracts its own unique crew, Saeroyi embarks on the next phase: taking down the very family who stole his father away from him. It’s time for revenge and to prove to the world what he’s worth.\n\n---\n- [Official Indonesian Translation](https://kakaopage.co.id/content/Itaewon-Class/3319)\n- [Official Japanese Translation](https://piccoma.com/web/product/1533)\n- [Official Thai Translation](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Itaewon_class/52)\n---\n- [Original Webtoon <kakao>](https://page.kakao.com/home/51761524)\n- [Original Book (Naver)](https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=15659489)  \n- [Original Book (Yes24)](http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/81524607)  \n- [Original Book (Aladin)](https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=214228483)\n- [English Volumes (Yen Press)](https://yenpress.com/series/itaewon-class)",
