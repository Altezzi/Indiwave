# Hybrid x Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia

Hida Kizuna possesses the HHG (Heart Hybrid Gear) ability, but it is not strong enough to make him particularly important. His older sister calls him to transfer to a strategic defense school, where many of the students (many of which are large-breasted girls) use their HHG abilities to fight invaders from another world while wearing extremely skimpy pilot outfits. Kizuna's fighting ability doesn't measure up, but his sister has another planâ€“ apparently having erotic experiences with Kizuna will allow the girls to replenish their energy or power-up.
