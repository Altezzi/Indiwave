# Afro Samurai

*Reads from Left-to-Right*

(from amazon.jp):

The original manga of the popular super-anime produced and voiced by Hollywood actor "Samuel L. Jackson" is now available in the U.S.!

The main character is an Afro-haired samurai. The antagonist is a cowboy gunman.

The setting is like a Japanese Jidaigeki with swordsmen fighting each other, but with cell phones, bow guns, missile launchers, and even androids.

And the background music is hip-hop.

"AFRO SAMURAI" is a new icon of pop culture that has sent the U.S. into a whirlpool of excitement and frenzy overnight!

*Note: Seven Seas Entertainment currently no longer owns the license for Afro Samurai, Titan Manga currently has it available in 2 volumes in both physical and digital formats. Please Support the official release.*
