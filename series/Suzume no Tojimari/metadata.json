  "title": "Suzume no Tojimari",
  "description": "On the other side of the door, was time in its entirety...\n\n17-year-old Suzume's journey begins in a quiet town in Kyushu when she encounters a young man who tells her, “I'm looking for a door.” What Suzume finds is a single weathered door standing upright in the midst of ruins as though it was shielded from whatever catastrophe struck. Seemingly mesmerized by its power, Suzume reaches for the knob… Doors begin to open one after another all across Japan, unleashing destruction upon any who are near. Suzume must close these portals to prevent further disaster.\n\nThe stars, the sunset, the morning sky, within that realm, it was as though all time had melted together in the sky. Drawn in by this mysterious door, Suzume's journey is about to begin.",
