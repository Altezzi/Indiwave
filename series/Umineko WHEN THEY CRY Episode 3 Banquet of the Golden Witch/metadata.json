  "description": "Time holds little meaning for Beatrice the Millennial Witch. Replaying the events leading up to the Golden Banquet again and again only gives her more opportunity to play with her new favorite toy, Battler Ushiromiya. The boy's will to resist the witch remains strong as the curtain rises for a third time on the Ushiromiya family's annual reunion. But as Beatrice pulls more and more players into the game, the strain on Battler's defenses is evident. Do the other members of his family hold the key to solving the witch's riddle and sealing her defeat?! [Yen Press]",
