# The Blooming Baby Boss Lady

"Gloriosa... You ugly thing that can't even bloom a single petal, you'd make perfect food for the trees-."

I was one of thirty-seven children of the Elvador family of the Flower People, and I was sacrificed to the tree that was the foundation of my family. Then, with the help of my betrothed, Arvid, my family was destroyed and I was only saved by my death.

When I woke up, I was transported back in time...? Do I have to relive my horrible past all over again? I wasnâ€™t even saved by dying?! ...If I have to start all over again, I'll save myself in this life-! This is Gloriosa's intense and endearing redemption.

Gloriosa Elvador can bloom flowers that produce harmless flames, but her evil brother, Magnus, deems her power worthless and feeds her to the sacred tree. Although she's resigned to die, she reawakens in the past as her 13-year-old self with a second chance at life. Now, she must find her cursed betrothed, Arvid Yultecia. Only he can save her from dying again, and only she can lift his curse. Will their blooming love be enough to save them both, or will Magnus trample their budding romance?
