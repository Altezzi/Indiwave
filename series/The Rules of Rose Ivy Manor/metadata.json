  "description": "Rosé Ovair thinks she woke up in a romantic love story where she's the rich heroine with a handsome fiancé, but her new home... isn't quite right. Her family seems to be keeping the cause of her father's death from her, and the servants all have fake names. Unfortunately, she is so enamored by the idea of marrying a good-looking man that she fails to notice much else! Will Rosé realize that breaking the rules of Rose Ivy Manor leads to deadly consequences.",
