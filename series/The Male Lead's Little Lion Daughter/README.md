# The Male Lead's Little Lion Daughter

The handsome Duke Voreoti is the most terrifying man in the empire, with the coldest of demeanors and a gaze that can kill. But one day, he suddenly says that he wants to… adopt a child?! And that child is me?! After finding me at a shady orphanage, he whisked me away to his snowy palace without a second thought. Now I’m learning all the ways of the feared Voreoti family from his knights. However, things get dicey when the Duke becomes suspicious of my origins. With these fangs and jet black hair, perhaps we are more than just kindred spirits…

"I'm going to adopt a child."

Duke Phileo Boleoti's impulsive decision shocked everyone in the mansion. Not only did he make her his daughter, but he also gave her the name of a 'beast' that only direct members of the bloodline could receive.

"Even as you breathe right now, I'm earning money."
"It's confidence, not arrogance."
"My face really does have its advantages."
The most arrogant father in the whole world, and-

"I love muscles the most. Let's get muscular."
"Show me your thigh muscles! Your butt would be even better!"
"You're nothing but a flower if you have a calm personality…" his corrupted(?) daughter. 

And… "I will give his excellency the information he wants most."

"Information I want most, you say…"

"You won’t regret it."

…A stepmother(?) with a strange secret as well.
